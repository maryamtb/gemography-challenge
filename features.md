As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row.
As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details:
- Repository name
- Repository description
- Number of stars for the repo.
- Number of issues for the repo.
- Username and avatar of the owner.
As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).
